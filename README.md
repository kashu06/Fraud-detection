# Fraud-detection
This project is an AI-powered agent that analyzes 20+ behavioral signals—such as device changes, typing patterns, and geolocation—to provide real-time session risk scoring. It significantly reduces false positives and improves fraud detection efficiency.

It also includes a Spring Boot + Thymeleaf dashboard for consent-based behavioral tracking and fraud monitoring, enabling analysts to quickly act on flagged sessions.
